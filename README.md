# Algorithms for the control and coordination of warehouse robot

- The aim of the diploma project is assemble the warehouse robot;
- Combine the skills of software development and working with electronic devices to assembly robot;


Tasks:
- Develop an interface for the execution of orders;
- Service to get information about the new order to the robot;
- The robot has to fulfill the order;
- Receipt of your order will take place by the client;
- The client has to send commands to the robot, the robot can execute the order; 
- Robot need to coordinate in warehouse. 


Movement algorithm
- The robot moves focusing on the marked field due to the light sensors;
- Light sensors are installed in six position of robot;
- Infrared distance sensors are mounted in front and back sides of robot;
- Buttons in the front and back sides are installed for emergency stop before obstacles;

Technologies:
- ARM-based processor STM32F100RB;
- Light sensors;
- Motor drivers

Robotic System
- A worker orders some item;
- System takes order and send task to client in the robot;
- Client communicate with the robot and send commands for robot.
